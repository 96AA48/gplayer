## gplayer

I made this initially to listen to music on tty based OSs, now it's one of my favorite ways to listen to music (in a terminal).
It's an entire music player in 60 lines of code, and also my first npm submission. Please have fun listening to your favorite music!

##Install :
```
npm install gplayer -g
```
